# Customer Segmentation Using K-means Clustering

## Overview
This project aims to segment customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior. We use the K-means clustering algorithm for the segmentation. The data includes transactional information such as age, gender, product category, quantity, and price.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- R Studio
- Necessary R packages (Refer to the script for the required packages)

### How to Run
1. Open the R script in R Studio.
2. Make sure to install all the required packages.
3. Run the script to perform clustering and generate insights.

## Files
- `retail_sales_dataset.csv`: Original dataset
- `df_with_clusters.csv`: Dataset with cluster labels
- `K-means_Clustering.R`: Main R script for performing K-means clustering
